    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This spicy cold tofu recipe requires no cooking and less than 10 ingredients. It’s a super tasty dish to add to any Chinese spread (or have as a quick meal on its own).</p>
    <p>Due to its no-cook nature, this recipe really shines during the warmer months, but you can enjoy it any time of year. Traditionally, you’ll find thousand-year-old eggs, also known as century eggs, in the dish, but they’re an optional ingredient if you don’t like them, can’t find them, or would rather keep the recipe vegan!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon spicy bean paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>.5 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, <i>minced</i></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons scallion, <i>chopped</i></li>
        <li>1 pound silken tofu, <i>or soft tofu</i></li>
        <li>1-2 century eggs, <i>peeled and cut into small wedges, optional</i></li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped, <i>and/or Thai basil, optional</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the soy sauce, bean paste, sesame oil, and sugar in a small bowl. Add half the garlic and half the scallions. Mix it all together.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the silken tofu from the package. First, slice the plastic around the block of tofu, and then use a paring knife to separate the tofu from the sides of the box. Then turn it over onto the serving bowl. Slice the tofu crosswise into 1/2 inch (1.2cm) thick slices. If using, arrange the pieces of century egg around the tofu. </li>
        <li>Drizzle the sauce over the tofu, and garnish with the rest of the garlic and scallion on top. You can also garnish with a bit of chopped cilantro and/or Thai basil. Stir everything together at the table, and enjoy!</li>
